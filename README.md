# Project-VIA

Project-VIA is a community of developers commited to implement free and open source software for social good.

## VIA
The core of the project is focused on VIA, a lightweight mobile application that bridges the communication gap between NGOs and the hard-to-reach population, in particular the internally displaced people. VIA aims to establish a one-stop-shop, safe and reliable canal of vital information for the most vulnerable. 

## Repositories
Project-VIA is under heavy development. The initial work is on a prototype composed of three repositories:
  * [via-mobile](https://github.com/jeanjacquesp/via-mobile): the mobile app client for android
  * [via-cms](https://github.com/jeanjacquesp/via-cms): the website for managing the content provided to the mobile app
  * [via-broker](https://github.com/jeanjacquesp/via-broker): the backend that manages the connection to the MQTT broker and the internal data exchange protocol with the devices

Note that the protoype version uses code/design shortcuts and is prone to errors.
